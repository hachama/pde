### Partial Differential Equations

This course provides an introductory guide to mastering essential techniques for solving partial differential equations (PDEs). It introduces learners to PDEs that arise from a variety of fields within engineering and the natural sciences. 

In many scientific disciplines, both pure and applied, the objectives can often be distilled into two key goals. First, formulating mathematical models, typically in the form of equations, to describe the phenomena of interest. Second, solving or analyzing these equations to derive meaningful insights and make predictions. The outcome of the first goal often results in a system of partial differential equations (PDEs), and thus the second goal requires understanding and solving these systems.

To provide a comprehensive overview of PDEs, we will explore a range of equations including: First-order PDEs, using methods such as Lagrangeâ€™s method and the method of characteristics; The Laplace and Poisson equations, fundamental to electrostatics; The diffusion equation, which models processes such as heat transfer and chemical diffusion; The wave equation, which describes the propagation of sound waves in a linear acoustical framework; Techniques like separation of variables and energy methods.

By the end of this course, you will have gained a solid understanding of how PDEs are formulated in various contexts and how to approach solving them using both classical andmodern techniques.
